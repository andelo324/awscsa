	<h2>Security Group</h2>
	<p>A Security group is a virtual firewall</p>
	<ul>
		<li>You can have multiple security groups attached to EC2 instances</li>
		<li>You can have any number of EC2 instances within a security group</li>
		<li>Any rules you change in the security group takes in effect immediately</li>
		<li>Any inbound Traffic is blocked by default</li>
		<li>All Outbound Traffic is Allowed by default</li>
		<li>Security groups are STATEFUL - If you create an inbound rule allowing traffic in, that traffic is automatically allowed back out again</li>
		<li>You cannot block specific IP addresses using Security Groups, instead use Network Access Control Lists</li>
		<li>You can specify allow rules, but not deny rules</li>
