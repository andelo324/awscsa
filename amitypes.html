<h2>EBS vs Instance Store</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>All AMIs are categorized as either backed by Amazon EBS or backed by Instance Store</li>
		<li>For EBS Volumes: The root device for an instanced launched from the AMI is an EBS volume created from Amazon EBS snapshot</li>
		<li>For Instance Store Volumes: The root device for an instance launched from the AMI is an instance store volume created from a template stored in S3</li>

		<li>Instance Store Volumes are sometimes called Ephemeral Storage</li>
		<li>Instance store volumes cannot be stooped. If the underlying host fails, you will lose your data</li>
		<li>EBS backed instances can be stopped. You will not lose the data on this instance if it is stopped</li>
		<li>You can reboot both, you will not lose your data.</li>
		<li>By default, both ROOT volumes will be deleted on termination, however with EBS volumes, you can tell AWS to keep the root device volume.</li>
