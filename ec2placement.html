	<h2>What is a Placement Group</h2>
	<p>A placement group is a logical grouping of instances within a single Availibility Zone. Using placement groups enables applications to participate in a low latency, 10Gbps network. Placement groups are recommended for applications that benefit from low network latency, high network throughput or both</p>

<ul>
	<li>A placement group can't span multiple Availibility Zones</li>
	<li>The name you specify for a placement group must be unique within your AWS account</li>
	<li>Only certain types of instances can be launced in a placement group (Compute Optimized, GPU, Memory Optimized, Storage Optimized</li>
	<li>AWS recommend homogenous instances within placement groups - instances of same size and same family</li>
	<li>You can't merge placement groups</li>
	<li>You can't move an existing instance into a placement group. You can create an AMI from your exisiting instance, and then launch a new instance from the AMI into a placement group</li>
</ul>
