	<title>S3 - Exam Tips for S3 101</title>
</head>
<body>
<div>	
	<ul>
		<li>Remember that S3 is Object based i.e. allows you to upload files</li>
		<li>Files can be from 0 Bytes to 5TB.</li>
		<li>There is unlimited storage</li>
		<li>Files are stored in Buckets</li>
		<li>S3 is an universal namespace, that is, names must be unique globally</li>
		<li>S3 buckets name look like https://(your region name).amazonaws.com/(unique S3 bucket name)</li>
	</ul>
</div>
<div>
	<h2>Consistency</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Read after Write consistency for PUTS of new Objects - New uploaded objects can be read rightaway</li>
		<li>Eventual Consistency for overwrite PUTS and DELETES (can take some time to propagate)</li>
	</ul>
</div>
<div>
	<h2>S3 Storage Classes/Tiers</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>S3 (durable, immediately available, frequently accessed)</li>
		<li>S3-IA (Infrequently Accessed - durable, immediately available)</li>
		<li>S3 - Reduced Redundancy Storage (RRS) (data that is easily reproducible such as thumb nails, etc)</li>
		<li>Glacier - Archived data where you can wait 3-5 hours before accessing</li>
		<li>Remember the core fundaments of S3</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Key (name of file)</li>
			<li>Value (data)</li>
			<li>Version ID</li>
			<li>Metadata</li>
			<li>ACL</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Object based storage only (for files)</li>
		<li>Not suitable to install an operating systen</li>
	</ul>
</div>
<h2>S3 - Versioning</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Stores all versions of an object (including all writes and even if you delete an object)</li>
	<li>Great backup tool</li>
	<li>Once enabled, Versioning cannot be disabled, only suspended</li>
	<li>Integrates with Lifecycle rules</li>
	<li>Versioning's MFA Delete capability, which uses multi-factor authentication, can be used to provide an additional layer of security</li>
	<li>Cross Region Replication, requires versioning enabled on the source and destination bucket</li>
</ul>
<div>
	<h2>S3 - Lifecycle Management</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Can be used in conjunction with versioning</li>
		<li>Can be applied to current versions and previous version</li>
		<li>Following actions can now be done</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Transition to the S3-IA Storage class (128kb and 30 days after the creation date)</li>
			<li>Archive to the Glacier Storage Class (30 days after IA)</li>
			<li>Permanently Delete</li>
		</ul>
	</ul>
</div>
<div>
	<h2>CloudFront</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Edge Location - This is the location where content will be cached. This is separate to an AWS Region/Availability Zone(AZ)</li>
		<li>Origin - This is the origin of all the files that the CDN will distribute. This can be either an S3 Bucket, an EC2 Instance, an Elastic Load Balancer or Route53</li>
		<li>Distribution - This is the name given the CDN which consist of a collection of Edge Locations. There are 2 types</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Web Distribution - Typically used for Website</li>
			<li>RTMP - Used for Media Streaming</li>
		</ul>
		<li>Edge locations are not just READ only. You can write to them too</li>
		<li>Objects are cached for the life of the TTL (you can change the value when you set up the distribution)</li>
		<li>You can clear cached objects, but you will be charged </li>
	</ul>
</div>
<div>
	<h2>Securing your Buckets</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>By default, all newly created buckets are PRIVATE</li>
		<li>You can set up access control to your buckets using:</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Bucket Policies</li>
			<li>Access Control Lists</li>
		</ul>
		<li>S3 buckets can be configured to create access logs which log all requests made to the S3 bucket. This can be done to another bucket.</li>
	</ul>
</div>
<div>
	<h2>2 Types of Encryption</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>In Transit - Achieved through SSL/TLS</li>
		<li>At Rest</li>
		<ul>
			<li>Server Side Encryption</li>
			<ul>
				<li>S3 Managed Keys - SSE-S3 (Server Side Encryption)</li>
				<li>AWS Key Management Service, Managed Keys - SSE-KMS</li>
				<li>Server Side Encryption with Customer Provided Keys - SSE-C</li>						
			</ul>
		</ul>
		<li>Client Side Encryption</li>
	</ul>
</div>
<div>
	<h2>Gateways</h2>
	<li>File Gateway - For flat files, stored directly on S3</li>
	<li>Volume Gateway</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Stored Volumes - Entire Dataset is stored on site and is asynchronously backed up to S3</li>
		<li>Cached Volumes - Entire Dataset is stored on S3 and the most frequently accessed data is cached on site</li>
	</ul>
	<li>Gateway Vortual Tape Library (VTL)</li>
	<ul>
		<li>Used for backup and uses popular backup applications like NetBackup, Backup Exec, Veeam etc</li>
	</ul>
</div>
<div>
	<h2>Snowball</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Snowball - Standard storage</li>
		<li>Snowball Edge - storage plus compute capabilities such as Lambda</li>
		<li>Snowmobile</li>
		<li>Understand what Snowball is</li>
		<li>Understand what Import Export is</li>
		<li>Snowball can Import to S3, Export from S3</li>
	</ul>
</div>
<div>
	<h2>S3 Transfer Acceleration/S3 Static Websites</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>You can speed up transfers to S3 using S3 transfer acceleration. This costs extra and has the greates impact on people who are in far away location</li>
		<li>You can S3 to host static websites. It's serverless. STATIC only, cannot host dynamic sites</li>
	</ul>
</div>
<ul>
	<li>Write to S3 - HTTP 200 code for a successful write</li>
	<li>You can load files to S3 much faster by enabling multipart upload</li>
	<li>Read the S3 FAQ before taking the exam. It comes up a lot! <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/faqs/">S3 FAQ Link</a></li>
