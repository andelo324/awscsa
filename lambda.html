	<h2>What is Lambda</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Data Centers</li>
		<li>Hardware</li>
		<li>Assembly Code/Protocols</li>
		<li>High Level Languages</li>
		<li>Operating Systems</li>
		<li>Application Layer/AWS APIs</li>
		<li>AWS Lambda</li>
	</ul>
<p>AWS Lambda is a compute service where you can upload your code and create a Lambda function. AWS Lambda takes care of provisioning and managing the servers that you use to run the code. You don't have to worry about operating systems, patching, scaling, etc. You can use Lambda in the following ways.</p>
<ul>
	<li>As an event-driven compute service where AWS Lambda runs your code in response to events. These events could be changes to data in an Amazon S3 bucket or an Amazon DynamoDB table</li>
	<li>As a compute service to run you code in response to HTTP requests using Amazon API Gateway or API calls made using AWS SDKs.</li>
</ul>

	<h2>What Languages can you use in Lambda</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Node.js</li>
		<li>Java</li>
		<li>Python</li>
		<li>C#</li>
	</ul>

<div>
	<h2>How is Lambda Priced</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Number of requests</li>
			<ul>
				<li>First 1 million request are free. $0.20 per 1 mission requests thereafter</li>
			</ul>
		<li>Duration</li>
			<ul>
				<li>Duration is calculated from the time your code begins executing until it returns or otherwise terminates, rounded up to the nearest 100ms. The price depends on the amount of memory you allocate to your function. You are charged $0.00001667 for every GB-second used</li>
			</ul>
	</ul>
</div>
<div>
	<h2>Why use Lambda</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>No Servers</li>
		<li>Continuous Scaling</li>
	</ul>
</div>
<div>
	<h2>Lambda Exam Tips</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Lambda scales out (not up) automatically</li>
		<li>Lambda functions are independed, 1 event = 1 function</li>
		<li>Lambda is serverless</li>
		<li>Know what services are serverless</li>
		<li>Lambda functions can trigger other lambda functions, 1 event can = x functions if functions trigger other functions</li>
		<li>Architectures can get extremely complicated, AWS X-ray allows you to debug what is happening</li>
		<li>Lambda can do things globally, you can use it to back up S3 buckets to other S3 buckets, etc </li>
		<li>Know your triggers</li>
	</ul>
